        <p>We have to make thousands of decisions everyday. This was one of the
             homework activity that challenged us to consider a implementing a chance mechanism 
             to make decisions for us in a day. I  decided to come up with a "Yes, No, Maybe"
             generator that I would use to influence my decisions.

             This activity made me think of a fortune cookie. Although most of us would probably
             not take the fortunes very seriously, once in a while it sure is fun to take out rationality 
             and leaves things to chance. Therefore a fortune cookie animation!
