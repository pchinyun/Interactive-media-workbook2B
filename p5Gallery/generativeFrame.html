        <p> Coming straight from HTML and Javascript,
            it was surprising to see how much faster it took to create cool visuals. 
            I was most impressed with how you could map function draw() to your mouse and
            loop a sequence of visuals. I did have to add a mechanism to stop animation at 
            150 shapes so that this website would not crash.
