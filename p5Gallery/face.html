        <p>This was one of the first homework activity for P5. I struggled 
            with it initially as I struggled to place each element at the exact
            coordinates. Then the next setback was that I hardcoded all the coordinates 
            while leaving my canvas at windowWidth and windowHeight. This caused
            my image to be completely distorted as it was unresponsive. I used Claude 
            to learn and understand how I can make my code responsive.

        <p>I used this tutorial to learn how to make the eyes map to the mouse position. 
            Although I learnt a fair bit from this, I encounted a few issues and used Claude 
            to teach myself how to debug and improve the code. As math is not my strong suit, 
            I do want to take more time to understand this concept a little better.
