        <p>
            Being able to access audio with just a few lines of code blew my mind. 
            Although this was one of the more glitchy effects of p5, I liked the possibility
            of mapping audio to visuals. It made me think of a Tiktok filer I saw recently that 
            had people sing in the right pitch in order to complete a race. If I had more time, 
            I would like to try and build a similar concept.

        <p>There was also another version of this, which changes the colour
            of the rings according to the volume of audio input.
