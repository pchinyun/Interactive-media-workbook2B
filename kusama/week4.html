            <p id="kusamaDescr">For class on week 4, we visited the Yayoi Kusama exhibition in the NGV. I wanted to see
                this exhibition for awhile now so I was really excited we got the opportunity to visit. 
                Having only read about Kusama's digitally, it was truly a highlight to get to experience 
                her artworks in person. What I liked most about the exhibition was seeing her early works such as Air Mail Stickers 
                as I was mostly only familiar with her later more popular works with polka dots and mirrors. I used her installations 
                as inspirations and created them in P5.JS with my own interpretation in a digital form.

                     Air Mail Stickers is a collage of the titular stickers, which read “VIA AIR MAIL.” I reinterpreted this 
                     art work using random sticker generators that fills the canvas with stickers.

                The inflatable objects in Dots Obsession made me think of a play with scale, so I 
                tried to recreate this by generating varying sizes of white polka dots on a red background

                    This was one of the P5 exercises we did in class. I find colouring the painting back in was
                    especially theraputic, I was at it for hours.
